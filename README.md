# Swift Extensions

These are extensions I personally use to make my life a little easier, most of them having to do something or the other with String manipulation, Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and anything and everything that is even a minor inconvenience.

## Index

- Strings
- GCD [Grand Central Dispatch]

### Strings
- [HTML to String](string/html_to_string.swift): Remove all HTML tags from a String
- [URL Check](string/url_check.swift): Check if a string is a valid URL

### GCD [Grand Central Dispatch]
 - [Easy GCD](gcd/gcd_extension.swift): Much easier way to use GCD without having to write fancy code.


## Known Issues

 - Need to update [URL Check](string/url_check.swift) to work with Swift 5.0
