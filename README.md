# Swift-Extensions

These are extensions I personally use to make my life a little easier, most of them having to do something or the other with String manipulation, Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and anything and everything that is even a minor inconvinence.

## Index

- Strings

### Strings
- HTML to String(string/html_to_string.swift): Remove all HTML tags from a String
- URL Check(string/url_check.swift): Check if a string is a valid URL
